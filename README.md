Binary Analysis Next Generation (BANG)

BANG is a framework for processing binary files (like firmware). It consists of
an unpacker that recursively unpacks and classifies/labels files and separate
analysis programs that work on the results of the unpacker.

Some intended uses:

* provenance detection ("what is inside this file")
* security scans ("are there any known security risks associated with this file")

## Requirements

The recommended way is to use [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix), run
`nix-shell` to load all the dependencies for the unpacker,
`nix-shell maintenance.nix` for the maintenance scripts and
`nix-shell analysis.nix` for the maintenance scripts.

`nix` will make sure that everything is downloaded and installed to run BANG.

In addition you will need to install the Kaitai Struct compiler. This is
described in the file `doc/kaitai-struct.md`.

### Other distributions without Nix

* a recent Linux distribution (Fedora 33 or higher, or equivalent)
* Python 3.9.x or higher
* pillow (possibly named python3-pillow), a drop in replacement for PIL ( <http://python-pillow.github.io/> )
* GNU binutils (for 'ar')
* squashfs-tools (for 'unsquashfs')
* cabextract
* 7z
* e2tools (for 'e2ls' and 'e2cp')
* zstd
* python-lz4 (possibly named python3-lz4)
* qemu-img (for VMDK files)
* psycopg2 (possibly named python3-psycopg2)
* python-snappy (possibly named python3-snappy)
* python-tlsh (possibly named python3-tlsh)
* tinycss2 (possibly named python3-tinycss2, not available on Fedora 26 and earlier)
* dockerfile-parse (possibly named python3-dockerfile-parse)
* openssl
* rzip
* mailcap (for mime.types)
* lzop
* OpenJDK (for 'unpack200')
* defusedxml (possibly named python3-defusedxml)
* icalendar (possibly named python3-icalendar)
* pyyaml (possibly named python3-pyyaml)
* ncompress
* util-linux (for 'fsck.cramfs')
* lz4 (for 'lz4c')
* elasticsearch (possibly named python3-elasticsearch)

and many others (see `shell.nix`, `maintenance.nix` and `analysis.nix` for a
full list).

Additionally install `sasquatch`:

## Supported hardware

It is assumed that BANG is run on little endian hardware (such as x86 or x86-64).

## Verified unsupported distributions

* Fedora 33 and earlier
* Ubuntu 16.04 and lower (Python version too old)

This doesn't mean that newer versions of Ubuntu are supported, they just
haven't been tested.

## Docker container (recently untested, assume broken)

```
docker image build -t bang .
docker container run --rm -it bang
```

or from the `src` directory, type

```
make dockerbuild
```

## Invocation

To unpack a file run:

This will output a directory with inside a number of files and directories.
The output directory can serve as input to the analysis scripts (and some
knowledgebase scripts).

## Developing

The recommended coding style is described in PEP 8:

<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>

It is recommended to run PEP 8 verification tools, for example
python3-flake8 (on Fedora).

Another tool that is highly recommended is `pylint`.
