# Notes

Various stock firmware files for relatively unknown brands (mostly from China)
can be found at various sites such as <https://xdafirmware.com/>. While these
sites are not recommended to be used they can be good resources for weird
file formats or for firmware variations.

Below is a list of models plus (if known), chipset. This is only as a list with
personal notes so in case a firmware for a particular chipset needs to be
downloaded it can be quickly found.

Not all the chipsets are known. Most Mediatek based devices have `MTxxxx` in
the firmware file name, typically 4 numbers (sometimes with `M` or another
character added). None of the firmware files have been downloaded to verify.
