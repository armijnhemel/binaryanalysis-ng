# YARA rule generation scripts

This directory contains scripts to generate YARA rules. There are two scripts:

1. script to generate YARA rules from source code
2. script to generate YARA rules from BANG results (binary files)

The script to generate YARA rules from binaries currently only supports ELF
and Android Dex. More formats will be added soon.

## When to use which processor

There are situations where it is better to use rules generated from source
code than rules generated from binaries.

The benefit of generating rules from binaries is that you do not need to
have access to the source code to create YARA files. The drawback is that
not every binary is well suited for this, due to how the binaries are
created or processed.

Generating rules from binaries seems to work really well for the vast
majority of dynamically linked ELF binaries but not for for example
Dalvik `.dex` files.

### Dynamically linked ELF binaries

Dynamically linked ELF binaries are created from object files that are
in turned created from source code files. Dependencies (like third parties)
typically do not end up in the dynamically linked ELF file (although there
are of course exceptions, for example when there is a complete copy of
third party software included in the package), so the separation between
package and third party code tends to be clean. Information extracted from
binaries in a package usually is from just that package.

### Android Dex files

For Android Dex files it is much more difficult to make a good match using
rules generated from binaries, as Dex files are much closer to statically
linked files: you will find a lot dependencies included in the `classes.dex`
files that cannot be found in the source code of a project, but can be found
in the dependencies.

By default many programs are also obfuscated or shrunk by Android tools
such as Android Studio:

<https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code>

which advertises obfuscation of class names and method names as a feature.

This makes rules generated from binary `.dex` files not very well suited.
It is much better to create rules from source code and focus on other
identifiers, such as the strings embedded in `.dex` files.

## Source code processor

The script takes source code archives, unpacks them, extracts data using
`ctags` and `xgettext` and generates YARA rules from them.

The source code script depends on the extension of the file to determine
the most likely programming language used in the source code file. Current
focus is on C/C++, Java (including Scala and Kotlin) and Javascript. Support
for more languages will be added in the future.

The script to process source code can be invoked as follows:

    $ python3 yara_from_source.py -c yara-config.yaml -s /path/to/source

The directory with source code should contain source code archives (currently
only TAR archives are supported, support for ZIP files will be added in the
future).

## Binary processor

The script takes result files of BANG scans (for example: Debian archive
files) and creates YARA files. Optionally it can use a list of low quality
identifiers that can be filtered to make the YARA rules simpler.

### Running BANG to extract identifiers

First you need to run BANG on a collection of files, for example all `.debs`
from Debian. It is recommended to use the following configuration options:

    removescandata = yes
    logging = no

These options will remove the scan output and prevents large log files to
be written as they will not be used by the YARA rule generator script.

Then run the script to generate the YARA files. The script has two mandatory
arguments: a configuration file (in YAML format) and the directory with BANG
scan results. An exanple configuration file `yara-config.yaml` is provided
in this directory and should be adapted to your local settings.

An example invocation could look like this:

    $ python3 yara_from_bang.py -c yara-config.yaml -r ~/tmp/debian

There are some settings in the configuration that determine which identifiers
will be written to the YARA files. These are described in the sample
configuration file.

It is possible to filter low quality identifiers (described later). These
should be passed to the script in Python pickle format:

    $ python3 yara_from_bang.py -c yara-config.yaml -r ~/tmp/debian -i low_quality_identifiers.pickle

### Low quality function names and variable names

There are several identifiers such as function names and variable names
that can be found in many binaries and that have generic names. Although
they can still be useful they can also lead to false positives if there are
only generic names. They also take up unnecessary space as YARA has a default
maximum number of rules (10,000).

Examples are:

* very short identifiers (a single character)
* identifiers that are a substring of other identifiers as these could lead to
  false positives in YARA (somewhat prevented by using `fullword` in YARA
  rules.
* identifiers that occur in many packages. A good example: weak ELF symbols
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_symbol> or identifiers that occur in
  packages that have been copied (cloned) and are included as "third party
  code" such as `zlib`, `libpng`, `sqlite` and so on.

A prefab list of low quality ELF identifiers can be found in the files
`low_quality_elf_funcs` and `low_quality_elf_vars`. These were collected by
looking at all identifiers found in (nearly) all ELF files in Debian 11.

Third party code is not yet labeled as such.

### Low quality strings

Similar to the function names and variable names there are also low quality
strings. Some examples are:

* very short identifiers (a single character)
* identifiers that are a substring of other identifiers as these could lead to
  false positives in YARA (somewhat prevented by using `fullword` in YARA
  rules.
* strings that appear in many packages. Good examples are strings that are
  present in packages that have been copied (cloned) and are included as "third
  party code" such as `zlib`, `libpng`, `sqlite` and so on.
* country names, timezones, names of device files (`/dev/null`, etc.)


A prefab list of low quality strings from ELF files can be found in the file
`low_quality_elf_strings`. These were collected by looking at all strings
found in (nearly) all ELF files in Debian 11.
